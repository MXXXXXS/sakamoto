## About

### The project name

[Clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash), the base of this project, who's logo is a lovely cat <img src="https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/raw/master/docs/logo.png" height="20px" style ="
position:relative;top: 4px" />which reminds me of another cat in anime [Nichijou](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou) named sakamoto. This project is relative to clash so it's natural to have a cat name for it.
